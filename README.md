## Live ASCII wallpapers

An animated scene, drawn in characters, moves behind the chat. You can set its motion (smooth or cell by cell), its
speed, its cell size and a backdrop behind the chat that keeps the text easy to read.

## Color themes

Each theme changes colors, fonts, corner shapes and shadows. Some react to tool calls: a glow while a tool runs, a
shake on an error.

## Make your own

Ask Claude to "make me a theme", with a text idea, a picture, or both. The `make-theme` skill asks which kind you
want, drafts it as an Artifact for you to approve, and then builds it.

## Before you install

The mod works in the Claude Desktop app's Code tab.

> **Unofficial.** This mod is built on the mods, extensions and other parts that Claude Desktop already has. It is
> not a supported theming feature, so a future update of Claude Desktop can break it.
>
> **Windows and macOS.** Linux is not done yet. Help from the community is welcome: issues and pull requests for it.

This is a community mod. It is not made or endorsed by Anthropic. Claude, Claude Desktop, Claude Code and Clawd
belong to Anthropic.

## Install

In Claude Desktop: open **Settings → Plugins**, press **Add → Add marketplace**, enter
`https://github.com/0toshigami/claude-desktop-themes.git`, then install **themes-for-claude** from it.

Or, at the prompt of a Claude Code terminal session:

```
/plugin install themes-for-claude --marketplace 0toshigami/claude-desktop-themes
```

Answer `y` to add the marketplace, then pick a scope.

From a shell:

```bash
claude plugin install themes-for-claude --marketplace 0toshigami/claude-desktop-themes
```

## First use

1. If `/themes` does not show in the command list (often only `/make-theme` shows just after the install), type
   `/reload-plugins` and then `/reload-skills`.
2. In a Claude Code session in Claude Desktop, type `/themes`. The Themes pane opens at the side of the chat.
   `/themes` works only inside a session. On the start page of **+ New**, typing `/themes` only starts a new
   session; type `/themes` again in that session to open the pane.
3. The first time, the pane shows only an **Install extension** button. Press it. It copies the extension that
   paints the themes into Claude Desktop's `extensions` folder and sets `REACT_PROFILE=1`, which makes Claude Desktop
   load it:
   - Windows: the folder is `%APPDATA%\Claude\extensions`, and the variable is set for your Windows account.
   - macOS: the folder is `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/extensions`. The variable is set with
     `launchctl setenv`, and a LaunchAgent (`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.0toshigami.themes-for-claude.plist`)
     sets it again at each login.
4. Quit Claude Desktop fully (Windows: also from the system tray; macOS: Cmd+Q) and open it again.
5. Type `/themes` again and press a theme's name to put it on. Press **Claude** to go back to Claude's own colors.

## Your own themes

- **Simple themes** go into `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\themes-for-claude\` (macOS: `~/.claude/themes-for-claude/`) as
  `<id>.json`, with an optional `<id>.css`.
  They show in the pane's "Your themes" row, and an update of the mod does not remove them.
- **Live wallpapers** go into the same folder: `<id>.json` with `"wallpaper": "<id>"`, and the scene as `<id>.js`.
  Pick it in `/themes` and it shows at once, with no restart.

## Uninstall

Uninstalling the plugin removes only its commands. The extension in `%APPDATA%` stays, so remove it first:

1. Type `/themes` and press **Remove extension**. It takes the mod's files and entries out of
   `fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi` in Claude Desktop's `extensions` folder. If no other mod uses that folder, it
   also removes the folder and the `REACT_PROFILE` variable (on macOS, the LaunchAgent too). If another mod uses the
   folder, it keeps both.
2. Restart Claude Desktop.
3. Uninstall the plugin: in **Settings → Plugins**, or with `claude plugin uninstall themes-for-claude`.
4. Optional: remove the marketplace too, which deletes its copy in `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\plugins\marketplaces`. Use
   **Settings → Plugins → Add → Manage marketplaces**, or `claude plugin marketplace remove claude-desktop-themes`.

Your own themes in `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\themes-for-claude\` (macOS: `~/.claude/themes-for-claude/`) stay. Delete
that folder if you do not want them.

If you uninstalled the plugin first, remove the extension by hand in PowerShell. The folder can hold other mods
too, so this deletes the folder and the variable only when the folder holds this mod alone:

```powershell
$d = "$env:APPDATA\Claude\extensions\fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi"
if (((Get-Content "$d\manifest.json" -Raw | ConvertFrom-Json).content_scripts.js -join ',') -eq 'theme.js') {
  Remove-Item -Recurse $d; [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('REACT_PROFILE', $null, 'User')
} else { "Another mod shares $d. Delete only theme.js, theme.json and event.json, and their manifest entries." }
```

On macOS, in Terminal:

```bash
d="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Claude/extensions/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi"
js() { plutil -extract "$1" raw -o - "$d/manifest.json" 2>/dev/null; }
if [ "$(js content_scripts)/$(js content_scripts.0.js)/$(js content_scripts.0.js.0)" = "1/1/theme.js" ]; then
  rm -rf "$d"; launchctl unsetenv REACT_PROFILE
  rm -f ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.github.0toshigami.themes-for-claude.plist
else echo "Another mod shares $d. Delete only theme.js, theme.json and event.json, and their manifest entries."; fi
```

## Safety

A theme's stylesheet goes on your logged-in Claude page, so the extension refuses any stylesheet that loads something
from outside it: no `@import`, and no `url()` except `data:`. A theme's `.json` and `.css` are data only.

A live wallpaper's scene (`<id>.js`) is code, and it runs on your logged-in Claude page. Keep only scene files that
you made or that you trust, the same as any other code you run.
